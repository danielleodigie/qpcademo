            <h4>Quantum Advantage of QPCA</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><p>The advantage of using qPCA is that it is efficient in revealing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of unknown low rank density matrices, a practice hard to do with classical PCA.</p></li>
                <li><p>qPCA reduces the method time, O,  by a factor of the whole size.</p></li>
                <li><p> O(Rslog(s)) â€”> O(Rlog(s))</p></li>
                <li><p> The revelation of eigenvectors with corresponding eigenvalues allows us to interact with the matrices more. For example, if a matrix models an electronic system, we are able to simulate chemical or physical properties if we also know its ground state. Such simulation properties include: correlation functions, state to state transitions, and chemical reactions. This is done by observing the corresponding eigenvectors of the matrix calculated.</p></li>
                <li><p>qPCA will be another tool used to speed up machine learning during clustering and pattern recognition, representing and analyzing large amounts of high dimensional data.</p></li>
                <li><p>qPCA is also helpful in state discrimination and assignment. It is a process that can take 2 given matrix states and a new state. It assigns the new state to one of the given states depending on if it is positive or negative exponentially faster.</p></li>

            <h4>Trial and Error with VQE</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><p>When we were first given the assignment we wanted to follow the theoretical structure given by the paper. But after deep investigation we discovered that it was not possible to employ the method in the LMR paper because it needed Quantum Ram to work. This does not exist yet. Our next approach was adding VQE to a classical PCE. As you know VQE solves for the minimum eigenvalue of a given energy system. Before, we used the maximum sum of squared distances to get the eigenvalues. However, solving for the maximum / minimum serves the same purpose because of the pythagorean theorem, it just takes a longer computing time to get the minimum. As we tried to implement VQE we faced the challenge of mapping any data set to an energy system such that the hamiltonian can compute it. With more time we could have figured it out, but we decided to look for another option. This is when we decided to use Quantum Phase Estimation instead. </p></li>

            <h4>Quantum PCA Step by Step</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><p>We were able to make the state vector portion of the code into a function such that we can compute QPCA for any 4 x 4 matrix of information. We then compared our results with the QPCA and PCA and received the same results.</p></li>
                <li><p>Step 1- We initialize our system in a random state.</p></li>
                <li><p>Step 2 - We run it through the quantum circuit</p></li>
                <li><p>Step 3 - We take the two points from the counts dictionary that represent the majority of the data</p></li>
                <li><p>Step 4 - We apply those probabilities into the QPE</p></li>
                <li><p>Step 5 - </p></li>
